vim-config
==========

My personal vim configuration and pathogen modules. It is set up to be generic, so it might benefit others as well.

## Installation
Installation on any Linux or OSX machine is pretty straightforward:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Remz-Jay/vim-config.git
cd vim-config
./linux-bootstrap.sh
```
## Credits 

The entire setup is based on Michiel Roos' configuration. You can say thanks at [@TuurlijkNiet][1]
